# The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy Game Info

## UNMARKED SPOILERS PRESENT, BE CAREFUL

This is a program, and associated data, to facilitate building a tree containing all the required info about events, deaths, and branches with the game.
Naturally this involves a lot of unmarked spoilers, and this will be filled out in the order we end up going through.

Spoiler info: this does expect you to have finished route 0 at a minimum, in theory you can avoid spoilers by not looking at route info you haven't played yet. Although as the name data is filled out as more info is gained that will be marked.
