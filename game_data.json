Eito also says that he got a special reward at everyone's behest, and that he gets to spend time with Takumi as he pleases. Eito then states that he's never done anything like this, as he's never been able to feel like this towards another human or want one like this.

She says she had been reading about human culture, and learned that humans sleep on beds. So she brought Takumi a bed he could sleep on for tonight. Takumi sits down on the bed next to V'ehxness, after which she stands up. She then says that she hardly ever sleeps, ever since becoming Supreme Commander. She begins the game and asks Takumi if he would serve her, become one of her subordinates. Takumi asks for a question before answering, so he asks if it is possible for them to coexist. V'ehxness answers no, only saying that Takumi may live. When V'ehxness asks him again to join, Takumi moves back to the floor and says that he will not. V'ehxness gives him the bed anyways, and continues watching Takumi until he falls asleep.",

She reveals that her strength isolated her as no one was ever willing to challenge her, making Takumi her much needed hope. She also reveals the lie was that she did not kill her father. However she still believed in the commandments due to him, but Takumi, godless and unafraid, was the one who shattered those. She then proceeds to chain Takumi by his neck and drag him around with her, forcing him to witness her ascent to godhood. However, even throughout this, V'ehxness didn't absorb any cryptogloblin. Finally V'ehxness and Dahl'xia meet in the gym, as Dahl'xia reveals that he did not absorb the Second Coming. Dahl'xia is easily defeated by her, Takumi asks her to kill Dahl'xia rather than torture him. In response V'ehxness reveals that she didn't aborb any cryptoglobin in order to have Takumi take it and become powerful enough to properly battle her. She sets him free so he can do this. Takumi then absorb everyone's cryptoglobin, and prepares to kill V'ehxness. They meet in the school's yard and prepare to fight.",

Eito tells him not to insult his intelligence, and that if he had really lost his spirit would have crumbled, but that he can still sense the fight in him. Eito orders Takumi to surrender, to give in to despair. Takumi however realizes that Eito can't take his body unless he gives into the despair and Eito. Takumi then stabs himself in the thigh with the knife that killed Eva. Takumi uses this to deduce that Eito can also feel pain, and uses this to inflict pain onto Eito via killing himself. He reveals his plan and his challenge: kill himself over and over to see if Eito can last through it all, and keep going until Eito fades away. After the first death via stabbing and being brought back by the Revive-O-Matic, Takumi elects to jump off the roof, after that he hangs himself, after that every kind of death he can think of: lighting himself on fire, drowning, taking  poison, anything he can think of. After over 100 iterations of this, some of the other Eitos grab his arm and try to stop him, however he jumps off the roof anyways. They're still there when he revives and says they won't move until he gives them an answer. Takumi in response simply stabs himself and dies that way. Upon waking up again, he stabs himself again, as Eito (brain) informs him that neither of them will last much longer. Several Eitos gather in Takumi's room and try to stop him, they brainstorm what could be happening. They then realize that Takumi absorbed Eito and part of his consciousness, and that he is using the pain of death to wipe out the Eito in his brain. Meanwhile Takumi kills himself via car exhaust. After Takumi wakes up, he walks to the edge of the roof again, but this time sees all the Eitos below cheering him on to not let Eito beat him. Takumi kills himself by jumping in front of them. When he wakes up they're there in his room cheering him on. So the cycle continued, hitting over 500 deaths, before finally passing out. When he wakes up, the SDU is begging him to come back, all of them in their normal bodies, meaning Takumi has won. Gaku reveals Tsubasa threw up every single time Takumi died. However, he stumbles over his words and says \"Takumi, I mean I'm back now\" and gains a big smile saying \"Now that I'm back the fun can really begin\".",

Wait for me inside. I'll explain everything later, but don't tell anyone about this until I do.\" Another Eito walks in, and Takumi in his rage kills him, as Eito informs him that multiple people were given that note, and he notes that \"she\" was the first one to show up. Eito forces Takumi to absorb the cryptoglobin of both dead Eitos. Takumi leaves the room, goes to the caf, sees three Eitos, and kills and absorbs all of them in his class armour. Neither of those Eitos were fake, as were any of the others he killed throughout the day.",

He then shouts that the 11th Eito is real, and its in his head, so that the only way to defeat him is to be killed himself. But he doesn't have to do it, the surviving members of the SDU walk in and Takumi asks them to kill him. They agree to with sorrow, and share the killing blow.",

That the SDU was taken from the TRC but were not put on Earth, instead on this planet. Eito states what he has learned from the invaders and their books: that humanity ruined their own planet, moved to underground shelters, and then left Earth to find a new planet. Sirei then takes over and explains that humanity developed the Exodus Project, a spaceship capable of moving at warp speed, the Artifical Satellite, and found a new planet: KXK-787. Located in a habitable zone that allowed for organic life, with most of the surface covered in water, a perfect match for humanity, a new planet in a galaxy far from Earth. Further its revealed that the TRC is inside the Artifical Satellite. Finally humanity arrived at the planet to find it occupied by intelligent life, filled with people born with cryptoglobin, seen as God's chosen by their culture. Humanity attempted to communicate but it broke down into conflict, with humanity unable to gain any upper hand due to cryptoglobin. Further, humanity's birthrate has been declining, so they need to take the planet or else it will die out. Sirei states that Last Defense Academy is a special spaceship deployed by the Artifical Satellite, while the SDU was onboard, and then had it surrounded by undying flames powered by Shion, and that the reason it is a school is because it fulfilled Shion's wish of being able to go to school like a normal child. Before this however, humanity started to research cryptoglobin themselves, around this time a being was born on the planet with near unlimited power, known to the Futurians (the denizens of the planet) as the Second Coming, this was Shion. Shion was stolen by humanity and likely accelerated cryptoglobin research. The group suggests using their ability to communicate to end the war, but that it is already too late and that this war can only end with elimination of one side and the control of Futurum (the planet). Eva upon all this being stated starts having another breakdown, kills Sirei before the group can pull her away. Shouma starts having an incredible headache similar to previous times he recalled something, is left in charge of Eva, as everyone else disbands.",

Takumi in this state opened her eyes and smiled at him, and it felt like she made a friend. She would continue to return to that room time and time again and take to Takumi in the machine. Once when talking to him his eyes even opened a little, and then lifted his arm and put his hand on the glass, seemingly trying to reach and touch Nozomi. For Nozomi this was confirmation that he could hear her and wanted to be friends. Eventually though, Nozomi was found and had her memories of this erased. All of this confirmed that Takumi did in fact know Nozomi, and this likely mixed with fictional memories of the TRC he was being fed in the pod. This appears to be the reason that Takumi knew a version of Nozomi (Karua). Nozomi attempts to use this to convince Takumi to continue living, that those memories were in some way real, that the memories they've made since arriving here were real.
