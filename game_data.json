Further he also states it is their secret weapon, however it is instantly destroyed by an explosion as soon as the invaders attack it. Right after that, the depressing music starts playing, as the giant Sirei's speakers are playing even louder now it has been destroyed. The SDU begins battle with Squad 11. The SDU battles and defeats Turamtammi, only for her to be revived by Nyewgank the commander of Squad 10. Despite this however, the SDU is able to defeat and absorb both.",

However, before he could break down the door, the baby shows up in his ghost form to discuss events and his plan with Takumi. Wherein he reveals that the bloodspace aura that was affecting him suddenly vanished a few days ago and that he has been investiating since. Further, he informs Takumi that he has accepted his death, and is willing to give his life for the escape pod, on one condition: Takumi may not board the pod, as he has done too much already to go back. Takumi agrees to it, but in reality is intending to board the pod anyways after the baby's death. Takumi then goes forward into the defense room and kills the baby, causing the system to shutdown and send out an emergency alert. Takumi then runs back to Kamyuhn and gives her the body, then runs to gather the SDU and take them to the escape pod. In the pod, the group puts together what happened. Kamyuhn starts up the escape pod sequence and final day sequence as everyone straps in after sharing the guilt with Takumi. However, shortly before takeoff, the entire system shuts off, with the escape pod not having enough energy to launch. With the baby's blood itself seeming to refuse to allow the launch to take place. Takumi is unable to work up the resolve to get off the escape pod, and everyone rushed off the escape pod to V'ehxness invading. The SDU was able to take down her and her army, but at the cost of every one of their lives.",

Takumi and Hiruko find the gym door locked from the inside, and break it down, only to find Kako poisoned with a bottle in her hand, they also rush her to the infirmiary as Takumi picks up the bottle. Hiruko demands that Yugamu and Nozomi take her to the infirmary, everyone else except Takumi and Hiruko continues to look for the other two. Hiruko discusses the events with Takumi, specifically that it was a locked room death and that Kako may have killed herself by drinking TTX poison, but that there could also be someone still in the gym. They search but are unable to find anyone, noting that its unlikely that Kako and Shouma died near the same time as her body was already cold and likely had been dead for hours. Hiruko and Takumi go to the infirmary to find out that Shouma has been revived but is unconcious, and that Kako could not be revived as she died between the hours of 01:00 and 04:00 (estimated), with traces of TTX in her body likely from oral ingestion. Darumi comes in and states she was playing slots in the rec room as she woke up late, finally Ima enters and says he was looking for Kako as when he woke up she was already gone. Takumi informs the SDU that Kako is dead and can not be revived, causing them to all tear up, and for Ima to fully break down. Yugamu gets an anesthetic and injects Ima, knocking him out until tomorrow. Hiruko and Takumi inform the rest of the SDU aout what they found in the gym. At night the SDU gathers in the pool room as no one felt like eating. Darumi presents the idea that it was the Sponsor who killed Kako, Gaku, Sirei, and attempted to kill Shouma. Hiruko also states that the culprit could be one of the SDU. Tensions rise as accusations are thrown around, Takumi's group, Darumi, Eva, an outsider, etc. Tsubasa says she can make a life detector in 7 days, allowing them to see how many people are alive on school grounds.

Takumi sits down on the bed next to V'ehxness, after which she stands up. She then says that she hardly ever sleeps, ever since becoming Supreme Commander. She begins the game and asks Takumi if he would serve her, become one of her subordinates. Takumi asks for a question before answering, so he asks if it is possible for them to coexist. V'ehxness answers no, only saying that Takumi may live. When V'ehxness asks him again to join, Takumi moves back to the floor and says that he will not. V'ehxness gives him the bed anyways, and continues watching Takumi until he falls asleep.",

However she still believed in the commandments due to him, but Takumi, godless and unafraid, was the one who shattered those. She then proceeds to chain Takumi by his neck and drag him around with her, forcing him to witness her ascent to godhood. However, even throughout this, V'ehxness didn't absorb any cryptogloblin. Finally V'ehxness and Dahl'xia meet in the gym, as Dahl'xia reveals that he did not absorb the Second Coming. Dahl'xia is easily defeated by her, Takumi asks her to kill Dahl'xia rather than torture him. In response V'ehxness reveals that she didn't aborb any cryptoglobin in order to have Takumi take it and become powerful enough to properly battle her. She sets him free so he can do this. Takumi then absorb everyone's cryptoglobin, and prepares to kill V'ehxness. They meet in the school's yard and prepare to fight.",

She then slashes Takumi's leg, mentioning cowardly tricks don't impress her, reveals that the lie was that she killed her father. She then orders to Takumi to wait for her to return. Meanwhile the SDU heads towards the Defense Room as Tsubasa stays to go get Takumi. Addamaque runs into her and tells her to go to Dahl'xia, and asks her to consume his power. After a brief bonding moment, she does so. Back to Takumi, Turamtammi runs into the leisure lounge and confronts Takumi, saying that ever since V'ehxness started talking to him she's been losing it. She proceeds to attempt to murder Takumi, but V'ehxness interrupts, taking a deep wound to save Takumi, and then kills and absorbs Turamtammi. Hiruko then enters, deals a blow to V'ehxness, and orders Takumi to kill V'ehxness. Takumi asks V'ehxness if she's ok, and chooses to save her. Saying he's just returning the favour of her saving him. V'ehxness protests, saying this is best opportunity. Takumi retorts that he still isn't done trying to make her see things his way, and that if she really wanted to kill him she would have done it already. Tsubasa then arrives, and stabs both Takumi and V'ehxness, saying she had to kill both in order to win. Takumi blacked out, only able to hear that V'ehxness yelled that she wouldn't let anyone else take Takumi and escaped with him.",

Upon talking to him he asks if they are Children of the Stars, the SDU doesn't know what that means, but promises to leave him alone if he tells them what he knows. He then tells them that is part of a group that has eschewed the war with the Children of the Stars and returned to their home, he then says that this planet is Futurum, and that it is not Earth, further he informs them that the first Children of the Stars descended and scorched the planet, trying to take the planet. Right after that, a Box of Blessing appeared. He mentions the boxes of blessing and calamity, and that V'ehxness as the current Supreme Commander and keeper of cryptoglobin she is the keeper of the boxes. The Boxes of Blessings grant any wish, while the Boxes of Calamity bring untold disaster. He says that some even say that the boxes are how God granted them cryptoglobin in the first place, and if that's true the boxes really are the start of it all. However through the years, the boxes' precise locations were lost, and became more of an ideal, a symbol of the Supreme Commander's authority. However, Supreme Commander V'ehxness has been seeking their power once more as the war came. Further, he also says he had a friend researching the boxes before the war, and there might be some results left around here somewhere. The SDU regroups at the academy, Takumi asks Sirei about this not being Earth. After some threats they get the truth out of Sirei, that humanity left Earth after World Death via the Exodus Project, and that the Artifical Satellite is a space ship. Before leaving they had discovered a planet, KXK-787, that in many ways was Earth's long list sister, located in a habitable space, with most of the planet covered in water. Also that the Tokoyo Residental Complex is inside the satellite. However their goal remains the same: defeat the Futurans and give humanity a new home.",

Naturally all hell breaks loose moments after this as everyone's backstories and personalities start colliding in increasingly bizzare ways. Finally the Ghost notices how long the alarms have been going off and decides to look around himself, going to find Takumi as he's the most likely to be able to solve this. Along the way he finds many SDU members with blank expressions and no movement, before finally getting dragged into the illusion himself. Wherein he discovers he beat Eva at tag in order to save the Earth from destruction. However, the Ghost still remains aware that this is an illusion, and almost gives into it as its better than a life in the machine. He then lights Takumi on fire again.",

Eito tells him not to insult his intelligence, and that if he had really lost his spirit would have crumbled, but that he can still sense the fight in him. Eito orders Takumi to surrender, to give in to despair. Takumi however realizes that Eito can't take his body unless he gives into the despair and Eito. Takumi then stabs himself in the thigh with the knife that killed Eva. Takumi uses this to deduce that Eito can also feel pain, and uses this to inflict pain onto Eito via killing himself. He reveals his plan and his challenge: kill himself over and over to see if Eito can last through it all, and keep going until Eito fades away. After the first death via stabbing and being brought back by the Revive-O-Matic, Takumi elects to jump off the roof, after that he hangs himself, after that every kind of death he can think of: lighting himself on fire, drowning, taking  poison, anything he can think of. After over 100 iterations of this, some of the other Eitos grab his arm and try to stop him, however he jumps off the roof anyways. They're still there when he revives and says they won't move until he gives them an answer. Takumi in response simply stabs himself and dies that way. Upon waking up again, he stabs himself again, as Eito (brain) informs him that neither of them will last much longer. Several Eitos gather in Takumi's room and try to stop him, they brainstorm what could be happening. They then realize that Takumi absorbed Eito and part of his consciousness, and that he is using the pain of death to wipe out the Eito in his brain. Meanwhile Takumi kills himself via car exhaust. After Takumi wakes up, he walks to the edge of the roof again, but this time sees all the Eitos below cheering him on to not let Eito beat him. Takumi kills himself by jumping in front of them. When he wakes up they're there in his room cheering him on. So the cycle continued, hitting over 500 deaths, before finally passing out. When he wakes up, the SDU is begging him to come back, all of them in their normal bodies, meaning Takumi has won. Gaku reveals Tsubasa threw up every single time Takumi died. However, he stumbles over his words and says \"Takumi, I mean I'm back now\" and gains a big smile saying \"Now that I'm back the fun can really begin\".",

Wait for me inside. I'll explain everything later, but don't tell anyone about this until I do.\" Another Eito walks in, and Takumi in his rage kills him, as Eito informs him that multiple people were given that note, and he notes that \"she\" was the first one to show up. Eito forces Takumi to absorb the cryptoglobin of both dead Eitos. Takumi leaves the room, goes to the caf, sees three Eitos, and kills and absorbs all of them in his class armour. Neither of those Eitos were fake, as were any of the others he killed throughout the day.",

That the SDU was taken from the TRC but were not put on Earth, instead on this planet. Eito states what he has learned from the invaders and their books: that humanity ruined their own planet, moved to underground shelters, and then left Earth to find a new planet. Sirei then takes over and explains that humanity developed the Exodus Project, a spaceship capable of moving at warp speed, the Artifical Satellite, and found a new planet: KXK-787. Located in a habitable zone that allowed for organic life, with most of the surface covered in water, a perfect match for humanity, a new planet in a galaxy far from Earth. Further its revealed that the TRC is inside the Artifical Satellite. Finally humanity arrived at the planet to find it occupied by intelligent life, filled with people born with cryptoglobin, seen as God's chosen by their culture. Humanity attempted to communicate but it broke down into conflict, with humanity unable to gain any upper hand due to cryptoglobin. Further, humanity's birthrate has been declining, so they need to take the planet or else it will die out. Sirei states that Last Defense Academy is a special spaceship deployed by the Artifical Satellite, while the SDU was onboard, and then had it surrounded by undying flames powered by Shion, and that the reason it is a school is because it fulfilled Shion's wish of being able to go to school like a normal child. Before this however, humanity started to research cryptoglobin themselves, around this time a being was born on the planet with near unlimited power, known to the Futurians (the denizens of the planet) as the Second Coming, this was Shion. Shion was stolen by humanity and likely accelerated cryptoglobin research. The group suggests using their ability to communicate to end the war, but that it is already too late and that this war can only end with elimination of one side and the control of Futurum (the planet). Eva upon all this being stated starts having another breakdown, kills Sirei before the group can pull her away. Shouma starts having an incredible headache similar to previous times he recalled something, is left in charge of Eva, as everyone else disbands.",

Naturally, the SDU takes this news very badly and starts to disbelieve it, however Yugamu backs it up by saying that everyone's DNA is remarkably similar, nearly identical, and that Shion is effectivly their father.

Takumi in this state opened her eyes and smiled at him, and it felt like she made a friend. She would continue to return to that room time and time again and take to Takumi in the machine. Once when talking to him his eyes even opened a little, and then lifted his arm and put his hand on the glass, seemingly trying to reach and touch Nozomi. For Nozomi this was confirmation that he could hear her and wanted to be friends. Eventually though, Nozomi was found and had her memories of this erased. All of this confirmed that Takumi did in fact know Nozomi, and this likely mixed with fictional memories of the TRC he was being fed in the pod. This appears to be the reason that Takumi knew a version of Nozomi (Karua). Nozomi attempts to use this to convince Takumi to continue living, that those memories were in some way real, that the memories they've made since arriving here were real.

He asks if there's anything Eva wants to do, specifically asking if there's anyone she misses, he specifically asks about Kamyuhn. This causes to break once again, however this time she seems to be aware of things, as if the brainwashing if wearing off. The brainwashing seems to be fully wearing off and Takumi asks her to keep quiet so the rest of the team doesn't kill her if they realize. She calms down, and starts putting together what happened what happened when she was brainwashed. She asks if he really wants to save her, and Takumi answers he does. She then reveals that Sirei brainwashed her and that if the others find out they will kill her. She then asks if he really will keep this a secret from his allies.",

[Editor's Note: Clair De Lune is playing]. Kamyuhn also comes out, willing to let her go, knowing te rebellion can take out whoever remains. Takumi and Eva arrive at the SDU just as they are being defeated, however just before she can attack the 3 remaining members (Eito, Nozomi, and Hiruko), Eva steps in and blocks her attack. V'ehxness slices through Takumi easily. V'ehxness and Eva argue about her choices and how just now she is finally willing to stand up to her. The two transform and are equally matched in battle. V'ehxness chastises her saying she will never understand what it is like to absorb another's power, however Eva goes berserk making V'ehxness realize she has, and welcoming her for it, saying they really are family. Takumi cheering on Eva until both sisters are exhausted. They lose their transformations and attack each other, Eva killing V'ehxness, however Eva is left completly exhausted from the fight, and has the life drain out of her as she tells Takumi she loves him.",

Hiruko leaves last, looking at Takumi and simply going \"Why?\" with a shocked expression. In the hallway Sirei and Takumi discuss why he didn't tell them, and Takumi says he didn't want them to not trust him as they wouldn't believe he isn't a time traveller. Sirei agrees and decides not to say anything. Afterwards Takumi goes to see the SDU in the courtyard, where they decide to let Eito live. Afterwards Takumi talks to Eito alone, where he says he went along with what Takumi said, keeping that night as their little secret. The entire SDU agrees to fight after hearing what Sirei has to say about their mission and their world. Later that night Hiruko comes to Takumi's room to interrogate him, she didn't find a diary in his room, and she believes Takumi came from the future. Upon getitng her confirmation, she goe sto leave, but Takumi asks why she reacted the way she did at first. She says she'll sleep on it, but says hiding he was a time traveller and keeping Eito alive were good decisions.",

Takumi and Hiruko talk afterwards, where she says she has changed her mind and decided not to tell him everything, especially since she has seen this play out before. Takumi later goes to try and get the truth out of Hiruko, finding her later and talking with Sirei, unable to hear what was said. Eventually, Sirei gave Hiruko something that fit into the palm of her hand. Takumi goes to Hiruko's room later to try and discuss something with her, but finds her missing, he then sees her exit the wall of fire and leave. He tries to follow her out, and eventually sees her and tries to follow her. He finds her in a facility and in a room with many machines, and pulls open a locker to find many outfits that appear to be like deep sea diving outfits, which she puts on. She also then says she needs to make the leap soon, she steps onto the centre machine and prepares. However Takumi tries to stop her and he thinks she will vanish, jumping at her. When Takumi comes to Hiruko asks what he was possibly thinking jumping in without a leap suit. She says that trying to perform a parallel leap without a leap suit puts incredible strain on the body. She reveals its already past midnight and on day 5. She tells him to stay here and rest as she leaves to go back to the academy. She opens a locket with 2 extingushers, which shouldn't be possible as Takumi left his outside, takes it, and leaves. Takumi ignores this, grabs the other extingusher and goes after her. He makes his way back to the school and inside, looking for Hiruko. He finds the morgue unlocked, and finds Eito's body under a sheet in it. Then he hears a loud noise above him, in the infirmiary, just to find Hiruko collapsing. He tries to shake her awake, which she does, but then she kicks him in the stomach and launches him. She then begins to strangle him, he passes out. When he comes to he sees a corpse recovery drone get sucked into the revive-o-matic with someone in the suit watching, then blacks out again. He wakes up, Hiruko informs him that she failed and \"couldn't save him\", she takes Takumi back to the leap room to go back. Further she also informs Takumi that she's not worried about Eito's body or Takumi seeing it. Finally Takumi suits up, and then preforms a parallel leap with Hiruko. Finally they go back to the academy, and Takumi goes to sleep.",
