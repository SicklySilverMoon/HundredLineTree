That the SDU was taken from the TRC but were not put on Earth, instead on this planet. Eito states what he has learned from the invaders and their books: that humanity ruined their own planet, moved to underground shelters, and then left Earth to find a new planet. Sirei then takes over and explains that humanity developed the Exodus Project, a spaceship capable of moving at warp speed, the Artifical Satellite, and found a new planet: KXK-787. Located in a habitable zone that allowed for organic life, with most of the surface covered in water, a perfect match for humanity, a new planet in a galaxy far from Earth. Further its revealed that the TRC is inside the Artifical Satellite. Finally humanity arrived at the planet to find it occupied by intelligent life, filled with people born with cryptoglobin, seen as God's chosen by their culture. Humanity attempted to communicate but it broke down into conflict, with humanity unable to gain any upper hand due to cryptoglobin. Further, humanity's birthrate has been declining, so they need to take the planet or else it will die out. Sirei states that Last Defense Academy is a special spaceship deployed by the Artifical Satellite, while the SDU was onboard, and then had it surrounded by undying flames powered by Shion, and that the reason it is a school is because it fulfilled Shion's wish of being able to go to school like a normal child. Before this however, humanity started to research cryptoglobin themselves, around this time a being was born on the planet with near unlimited power, known to the Futurians (the denizens of the planet) as the Second Coming, this was Shion. Shion was stolen by humanity and likely accelerated cryptoglobin research. The group suggests using their ability to communicate to end the war, but that it is already too late and that this war can only end with elimination of one side and the control of Futurum (the planet). Eva upon all this being stated starts having another breakdown, kills Sirei before the group can pull her away. Shouma starts having an incredible headache similar to previous times he recalled something, is left in charge of Eva, as everyone else disbands.",

Takumi in this state opened her eyes and smiled at him, and it felt like she made a friend. She would continue to return to that room time and time again and take to Takumi in the machine. Once when talking to him his eyes even opened a little, and then lifted his arm and put his hand on the glass, seemingly trying to reach and touch Nozomi. For Nozomi this was confirmation that he could hear her and wanted to be friends. Eventually though, Nozomi was found and had her memories of this erased. All of this confirmed that Takumi did in fact know Nozomi, and this likely mixed with fictional memories of the TRC he was being fed in the pod. This appears to be the reason that Takumi knew a version of Nozomi (Karua). Nozomi attempts to use this to convince Takumi to continue living, that those memories were in some way real, that the memories they've made since arriving here were real.
